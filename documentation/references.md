### Adding a Bibliography Citation

If you want to add a reference either when creating a lab, or in a large text input as a student, you must first find its BibTex notation on either [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/), [Zbib](https://zbib.org/), or any online library that offers such a service.

#### Acquiring BibTex Notation

First, lookup the name of the reference on your scholar search engine of choice. The following examples will use Google Scholar.

Look up and find the article you wish to cite, and click on the quotations icon

![Cite Icon](/Images/cms/annotation-2020-05-05-133228.png)

Which will open a window similar to the following:

![Cite Window](/Images/cms/annotation-2020-05-05-13322.png)

In the bottom left, click BibTex to generate the BibTex code. It will look something along the lines of this:

```
@book{chatterjee2015regression,
  title={Regression analysis by example},
  author={Chatterjee, Samprit and Hadi, Ali S},
  year={2015},
  publisher={John Wiley \& Sons}
}
```

Copy it, then back on OCLaRE, in the lab you wish to insert the citation, navigate to the bibliography tab, and click Add Record. Paste the code acquired from Google Scholar in the text box and submit. you should then be able to return to whichever tab your wanted to add the citation to, click the citation icon, and select the reference you wish to cite and press ok.
